Enable Client-Client Chat
===================

In this activity, you will learn to broadcast the message to all the clients by defining, calling, and starting a thread.

Follow the given steps to complete this activity:

1. Receive the broadcasted message
* Create the receive() function, then create an infinite loop using a while statement with the condition True. Inside the loop, add a try block to handle potential exceptions. 
~~~python
def receive():
    while True:
	try:
~~~


* Receive a message from a network connection represented by the client object. Read up to 2048 bytes of data and decode it using UTF-8 encoding. Finally, ​​print the received message.
~~~python
message = client.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')
print("Message from server: ", message)
~~~


* Add an except block in case an exception occurs during message reception and print a generic error message to the console.
~~~python
except:
	print('Error while sending to', connection)
~~~


* Close the client socket, and break out of the infinite loop, to terminate the receive() function.
~~~python
client.close()
break
~~~

2. Create and start a thread to write messages


* Create a new thread object named receive_thread using the Thread constructor. Set the target parameter to receive.
~~~python
receive_thread = Thread(target=receive)
~~~


* Start the thread by invoking the start() method on the receive_thread object to execute the receive function in parallel with the main program or other threads.
~~~python
receive_thread.start()
~~~


* Save and run the code to check the output.
