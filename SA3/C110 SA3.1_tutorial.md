===================

In this activity, you will learn to define a function to send client message threads to other clients.

Follow the given steps to complete this activity:


1. Loop through each client
* Open the 'server.py' file.


* Define a broadcast function that takes two parameters message and connection. Inside the function, declare the variable clients as a global variable.
~~~python
def broadcast(message, connection):
	global clients
~~~


* Initiate a loop that iterates through each client in the clients list. 
~~~python
for client in clients:
~~~


2. Check if the client is not the sender
* Check if the current client in the loop (client) is not the same as the specified connection. To avoid sending the message back to the client that originated it.
~~~python
if client != connection:
~~~


3. Send a message or throw an exception error
* Inside the loop, add a try block to handle potential exceptions that may occur during message transmission. And print a statement indicating that a message is being sent to a client.
~~~python
try:
print("Sending to client")
~~~


* Send the message to the current client (client) after encoding it in UTF-8 format. 
~~~python
client.send(message.encode('utf-8'))
~~~


* Add an except block in case an exception occurs during message transmission, and print an error message.
~~~python
except:
	print('Error while sending to', connection)
~~~


4. Broadcast a message.
* Broadcast the message in the clientThread() function by calling the broadcast function with two parameters message and connection
~~~python
broadcast(message, conn)
~~~


* Save and run the code to check the output.
